## Database Management Systems
A `Database Management System (DBMS)` is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. 

- It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.

## Types of DBMS
### Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):
`Data Model:` Organizes data into two-dimensional tables (rows and columns).
`Key Features:` Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data.
Each table has a primary key that uniquely identifies records.
Example: PostgreSQL, MySQL

### Object-Oriented Database:
Combines relational database concepts with object-oriented principles.

Represents data as objects (used in object-oriented programming).
Example: MongoDB.

### Graph (Network) Database
Data elements are organized like a graph, allowing more than one parent for a child record.
Example: Neo4J

## Data Modelling

### Aim
- `Information` contained in the database
(entities: students, courses, accounts, branches, patients)
- `elationships` between data items
(John is enrolled in COMP3311, Tom's account is held at Coogee)
- `Constraints` on data
(7-digit IDs, students can enrol in no more than 3 courses per term)

### Inputs and Outputs
`Inputs`: enterprise to be modelled, user requirements   
`Outputs`: (semi) formal description of the database structure

### Object vs Record
`Object-based data models`  
- treat database as a collection of entities of various kinds
- provide very flexible/natural data structuring facilities
- may also allow description of code for actions on objects

`Record-based data models`
- treat database as a collection of fixed-size records
- less flexible data structures than with object-based models
- closer to physical level so easier to implement efficiently
