## Database Management Systems
A `Database Management System (DBMS)` is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. 

- It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.

## Types of DBMS
### Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):
`Data Model:` Organizes data into two-dimensional tables (rows and columns).
`Key Features:` Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data.
Each table has a primary key that uniquely identifies records.
Example: PostgreSQL, MySQL

### Object-Oriented Database:
Combines relational database concepts with object-oriented principles.

Represents data as objects (used in object-oriented programming).
Example: MongoDB.

### Graph (Network) Database
Data elements are organized like a graph, allowing more than one parent for a child record.
Example: Neo4J

## Data Modelling

### Aim
- `Information` contained in the database
(entities: students, courses, accounts, branches, patients)
- `Relationships` between data items
(John is enrolled in COMP3311, Tom's account is held at Coogee)
- `Constraints` on data
(7-digit IDs, students can enrol in no more than 3 courses per term)

### Inputs and Outputs
`Inputs`: enterprise to be modelled, user requirements   
`Outputs`: (semi) formal description of the database structure

## Model Types 
- logical models deal with conceptual modelling of information
- physical models deal with physical layout of data in storage

Two main groups of logical data models:
- object-based models  
  e.g. object-oriented, semantic
- record based models  
e.g. relational, network, hierachical, 

### Object vs Record
`Object-based data models`  
- treat database as a collection of entities of various kinds
- provide very flexible/natural data structuring facilities
- may also allow description of code for actions on objects

`Record-based data models`
- treat database as a collection of fixed-size records
- less flexible data structures than with object-based models
- closer to physical level so easier to implement efficiently

## Entity-Relationship (ER) Modelling
The world is viewed as a collection of inter-related entities.

ER has three major `modelling constructs`:
- `attribute`: data item describing a property of interest
- `entity`: collection of attributes describing object of interest
- `relationship`: association between entities (objects)

## ER Diagram
ER Diagrams are a graphical tool for data modelling.
- a collection of `entity set` definitions
- a collection of `relationship set` definitions
- `attributes` associated with entity and relationship sets
- `connections` between entity and relationship sets

## Entity Sets
An `entity set` can be viewed as either:
- a set of entities with the same set of attributes (extensional)
- an abstract description of a class of entities (intensional)

`Key (superkey)`: any set of attributes whose set of values are `distinct over entity set`
- natural (e.g., name+address+birthday) or artificial (e.g., SSN)

`Candidate key` = minimal superkey (no subset is a key)  
`Primary key` = candidate key chosen by DB designer

Indicated by underline in ER diagrams

## Relationship Sets
`Relationship`: an association among several entities
e.g., Customer(9876)   is the owner of   Account(12345)

`Relationship set`: collection of relationships of the same type  
`Degree` = number of entities involved in reln (in ER model, ≥ 2)  
`Cardinality` = number associated entities on each side of reln  
`Participation` = must every entity be in the relationship

### Degree

### Cardinality
`one-to-one	`	
- each a is associated with at most one b
- each b is associated with at most one a
  
`one-to-many`
- each a is associated with zero or more b
- each b is associated with at most one a
  
`many-to-one`	
- each a is associated with at most one b
- each b is associated with zero or more a
  
`many-to-many`
- each a is associated with zero or more b
- each b is associated with zero or more a

## Weak Entity Set
`Weak entities` exist only because of association with other entities.

- family of employees in a company
(would not be interested in the family once the employee leaves)

Weak entities
- do not have a primary key (or any superkey)
- have a subset of attributes that form a `discriminator`
- need to be considered in conjunction with strong entities

ER diagrams:
- weak entities are denoted by `double-boxes`
- strong/weak entity relationships are denoted by `double-diamonds`
- discriminators are denoted by `dotted underline`

## Subclasses and Inheritance
A subclass of an entity set A is a set of entities:
- with all attributes of A, plus (usually) it own attributes
- that is involved in all of A's relationships, plus its own

If an entity set has multiple subclasses, they may be:
- `disjoint` - an entity belongs to at most one subclass
- `overlapping` - an entity may belong to several subclasses

An orthogonal property is the completeness contraint:
- `total` - all entities must belong to at least one subclass
- `partial` - some entities may belong to no subclass

## Limitations of ER Models
There are some design aspects that ER does not deal with:

`attribute domains`
- e.g. should phone "number" be represented by number or string?

`computational dependencies`
- e.g. employee's salary is determined by department and level
  
`general constraints`
- e.g. manager's budget is less than 10% of the combined budget of all departments they manage

## Relational Model
The relational data model describes the world as: 
- a collection of inter-related relations (or tables)

Goal of relational model:
- a simple, general data modelling formalism
which maps easily to file structures (i.e. implementable)

### Terminology
`Attribute`: data item with a name and a type/domain
- account_balance has domain non-negative integer

`Tuple of R` : an element of D1 × D2 × ... × Dn   
- (1234567, John Smith, BE, SENG, 75.2)
- tuples: (2,3)  ≠  (3,2)
  
`Instance of R` : subset of D1 × D2 × ... × Dn   
-  { (1,2,3), (3,2,1), (1,3,5), (2,4,6) }
- relation: { (a,b), (c,d) }  =  { (c,d), (a,b) }

<br>

- Domains are comprised of `atomic` values (e.g. integer, string, date) (no composite or multi-valued attributes)
- A distinguished value `NULL` belongs to all domains
- Each relation has a `key` (subset of attributes unique for each tuple)
- A `database` is a collection of associated relations.
